# Technology
Raugupati Log follows the following architectural principles:

## Development Environment
- **Development in devcontainer**: Fully containerized development environment using Docker with VS Code integration. Includes all necessary tools, dependencies, and extensions pre-configured for immediate productivity. Ensures consistent development experience across different machines and operating systems.

## Architecture Philosophy
- **Domain-driven structure**: Code organized by feature domain (users, fermentation, etc.) rather than by technical layers. This approach follows the coupling and cohesion principles, resulting in:
  - **High cohesion**: Related code (models, handlers, repositories, templates) grouped together in domain modules
  - **Low coupling**: Domains are isolated with clear boundaries, reducing dependencies between features
  - **Better maintainability**: Easier to find and modify related code
  - **Reduced merge conflicts**: Changes to one domain don't affect others
  - **Scalability**: New domains can be added following the same pattern

- **Simple architecture approach**: Monolithic application design prioritizing maintainability and ease of deployment over complex microservices. Clear separation of concerns with well-defined layers (presentation, business logic, data access) while avoiding over-engineering for the application scale.

## Deployment & Runtime
- **OCI Container compatible App**: Application packaged as standard container images following Open Container Initiative specifications. Supports deployment on any container orchestration platform (Docker, Kubernetes, Podman) with health checks, graceful shutdown, and resource constraints properly configured.

## Development Language
- **Rust Programming Language**: Modern systems programming language providing memory safety, thread safety, and zero-cost abstractions without garbage collection. Rust's ownership system prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races at compile time, ensuring robust fermentation tracking without runtime crashes.

- **Performance Characteristics**: Compiled to native machine code with optimizations comparable to C/C++, delivering:
  - Fast temperature data processing and chart generation for real-time fermentation monitoring
  - Minimal memory footprint ideal for deployment on resource-constrained servers
  - Efficient concurrent handling of multiple users logging fermentation data simultaneously
  - Near-zero runtime overhead for the web server and database operations
